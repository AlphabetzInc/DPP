PROBLEM STATEMENT
John and Brus are studying string theory at the university.  Brus likes palindromes very much.  A palindrome is a word that reads the same forward and backward.  John would like to surprise Brus by taking a string s, and appending 0 or more characters to the end of s to obtain a palindrome.  He wants that palindrome to be as short as possible.  Return the shortest possible length of a palindrome that John can generate.
